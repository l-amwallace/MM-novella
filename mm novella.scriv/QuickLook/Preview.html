<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is where you introduce C1 and possibly also C2, though obviously in different scenes. We also might not meet C2 until C1 meets them. Show your readers what your character’s normal world is like and give us an idea of what they’re really like as a person, including their strengths and weaknesses.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Two big things should be happening here, though they don’t have to be in the same scene. First, a Big Problem is going to change everything in terms of your character’s outer layer of the story. Second, C1 meets C2. (If they already know each other, this is the first time they meet in your story and it could be the first time they’re having a romantic spark with each other.)</span></p></p>

<p class="itemText">1C: MAKING EXCUSES + A NEW EXTERNAL GOAL</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">A romance novel is going to need a lot of ups and downs, or should we say, going towards each other and pulling away from each other. C2 might already be pursuing C1, but C1 should be adamant that they’re not going to have a relationship with this person even if they are attracted to each other. </span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The existing problems you introduced in Normal World are the reason behind these excuses and your character needs to deal with them before their happy ending. M...</p>

<p class="itemText">1D: THEY CAN’T AVOID EACH OTHER</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although C1 and C2 might have no desire to pursue a relationship together, something still forces them to spend time together. Maybe they’re fake-dating, stuck in a snowstorm in the same cottage, their competing bookstores are going after the same customers or maybe they keep owing favours to each other (like in I Owe You One by Sophie Kinsella). Whatever it is, it’s your convenient excuse to put these two dummies together in a way that they can’t avoid.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemText">2A: NEW WORLD, OLD PROBLEMS</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is the beginning of the next quarter of your story where your characters are still reacting to all the changes until something big happens again at midpoint. C1 and C2 should be falling in love during this quarter.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember Normal World? Your characters are now living in a New World. They could be in a completely new location but not necessarily - when everything changed, it either made your character see the world differently or some other conditions changed dr...</p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">If only C1 made excuses earlier, this is where you could show C2’s excuses for why they absolutely shouldn’t be in love with C1. Otherwise, restate why they think it really would be a terrible idea for them to be in a relationship. Their existing problems are still there and they’re the reason why C1 (or both C1 and C2) can’t open their heart for love.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">No matter what they are, excuses are still only excuses. Because C1 and C2 are spending so much time together and things are going so well, their excuses are being attacked. This should be the first time they start thinking “what if” instead of “absolutely not”, although they still have a long way to go before their excuses are destroyed and existing problems are solved.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Something needs to trigger the “what if”, and it can be an intimate moment spent together or ...</p>

<p class="itemText">2D: DRAMATIC EVENT AT MIDPOINT</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Something big always needs to happen in the middle of the story, whether it’s a new disaster or learning information that changes everything. That’s for the external layer of your story.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> When it comes to the external layer, you could have a false victory OR an apparent defeat, but when it comes to the inner layer that deals with the characters’ love life, it has to be a false victory. They’ve been more intimate than ever - and you want true, emotional intimacy - ...</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">3A: PULLING AWAY</p>
<p class="itemText">3A: PULLING AWAY</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is the beginning of the third quarter of your story. Your characters should become more proactive in trying to reach their external goals instead of just reacting, but they’re still doing things the wrong way and letting their weaknesses take the wheel. C1 and C2 are retreating from each other because of their fears and misconceptions.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember what I said earlier about going towards each other and then pulling away? Now is the time to pull away again. The “victory” you ju...</p>

<p class="itemText">3B: RETREAT FROM EACH OTHER</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The doubts and fears win. Your characters are so afraid of getting hurt that giving each other a chance becomes impossible and they retreat from each other. Unlike sensible people, they don’t talk about their worries with each other, but they do (or at least C1 does) admit to someone why they’re doing this.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">All their doubts and excuses have become a self-fulfilling prophecy - or at least that’s what C1 and C2 think. They’re certain they’ve been right all along and sh...</p>

<p class="itemText">3C: DISASTER STRIKES</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">For your external plot, this is where the very worst happens. Maybe the bookstore’s opening day is a disaster or maybe the murderer escapes from right under their noses. In other words, your character should be hitting rock bottom.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is equally catastrophic for the romance layer of the story. Maybe they just broke up in the previous scene and they’re now having a heated screaming match at the local Starbucks, but whatever it is, it needs to be an equal rock bottom moment. ...</p>

<p class="itemText">4A: THE CONSEQUENCES + THE REALISATION</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is the beginning of your final quarter. Here all the loose ends are tied and problems get solved because your characters learned their lessons and learned to look past their misconceptions.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your characters have made their choices and they think they should be feeling better about it, but unfortunately, they actually feel pretty rubbish. They remember all the good times they had during New World, Old Problems and they can’t help but realise they’re res...</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">4B: THE LAST PUSH</p>
<p class="itemText">4B: THE LAST PUSH</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over the course of the story, your character has made a lot of bad decisions and taken wrong turns while trying to solve their external problems. Because they’ve finally learned their lesson OR they’re about to learn it, they’re ready to try a whole new course of action. They might even have to sacrifice something to make things work, but in any case, this is their last, desperate push to fix everything.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The same thing goes for the inner layer, though obviously it doesn’t have...</p>

<p class="itemText">4C: CLOSING IMAGE AND THE NEW NORMAL</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The lovers have now been united and all the problems are behind them. Everything in the outer layer of the story has been nicely tied up as well and all there is to do is to show what the New Normal is like. </span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">To add more meaning to this final scene, you could mirror the beginning of the story, for example the very first scene or the scene where C1 and C2 met. Give your readers enough so that they can be satisfied with the information but end the story sooner...</p>
